A CLI tool to execute SQL queries on xlsx files.

![xlsxsql query -H -o md "SELECT a.id,a.name,b.price FROM testdata/test3.xlsx::.C1 AS a LEFT JOIN testdata/test3.xlsx::.F4 AS b ON a.id=b.id"](docs/xlsxsql.png)

| id |  name  | price |
|----|--------|-------|
|  1 | apple  |   100 |
|  2 | orange |    50 |
|  3 | melon  |   500 |

Execute SQL on xlsx files using [xcelize](https://github.com/qax-os/excelize) and [trdsql](https://github.com/noborus/trdsql).
Output to various formats.

### List sheets

```console
$ xlsxsql list test.xlsx
Sheet1
Sheet2
```

### Basic usage

The basic usage of xlsxsql is to run a SQL query against an Excel file.
The `query` command is used followed by the SQL query in quotes.
The SQL query should include the name of the Excel file. If no sheet is specified, the first sheet will be targeted.

```console
xlsxsql query "SELECT * FROM test.xlsx"
```

For example, if test.xlsx contains the following data in its first sheet:

| Name  | Age |
| ----- | --- |
| Alice | 20  |
| Bob   | 25  |
| Carol | 30  |

The output will be:

```csv
Name,Age
Alice,20
Bob,25
Carol,30
```

### Specify sheet

The sheet can be specified by using a double colon "::" after the file name
(the first sheet is selected by default if not specified).

```console
xlsxsql query "SELECT * FROM test.xlsx::Sheet2"
```

### Specify cell

Cell can be specified by using a dot "." after the sheet.

```console
xlsxsql query "SELECT * FROM test3.xlsx::Sheet1.C1"
```

Optional if the sheet is the first sheet.

```console
xlsxsql query "SELECT * FROM test3.xlsx::.C1"
```

Note: If cell is specified, the table up to the blank column is considered to be the table.
â€‹
This allows multiple tables to be specified on one sheet, and JOIN is also possible.

```console
xlsxsql query -H -o md \
"SELECT a.id,a.name,b.price 
  FROM testdata/test3.xlsx::.C1 AS a
  LEFT JOIN testdata/test3.xlsx::.F4 AS b 
    ON a.id=b.id"
```

### Shorthand designation

The `table` command is a shorthand that allows you to quickly display the contents of a specified sheet in a table format.
The syntax is `xlsxsql table <filename>::<sheetname>.<cellname>`.
If no sheet name is specified, the first sheet of the Excel file will be targeted.

Here is an example:

```console
xlsxsql table test.xlsx::Sheet2.C1
```

### Output format

```console
xlsxsql query --out JSONL "SELECT * FROM test.xlsx::Sheet2"
```

You can choose from CSV, LTSV, JSON, JSONL, TBLN, RAW, MD, VF, YAML.

### Header Options

The `--header` or `-H` option treats the first line as a header.
Headers are treated as column names.
For example, use:

```console
xlsxsql query --header --out JSONL "SELECT * FROM test.xlsx::Sheet2"
```

### Skip Options

The `--skip` or `-s` option skips the specified number of lines.
For example, you would use it like this:

```console
xlsxsql query --skip 1 "SELECT * FROM test.xlsx::Sheet2"
```

Skip is useful when specifying sheets, allowing you to skip unnecessary rows.
(There seems to be no advantage to using skip when specifying Cell.)
